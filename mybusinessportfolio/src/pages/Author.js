                <h2>Childhood</h2>
                <p className="born">
                  Born to Manuel Padilla and Cynthia Peters on March 24, 1979,
                  in Apple Valley, California, I grew up poor and fully aware.
                  By the age of four, I could discern the good and bad in
                  people. I sensed their true intentions. I looked to my parents
                  and other adults in my life to understand why people chose
                  good over bad, or bad over good. I remember observing the good
                  that adults did for others and began building my core beliefs.
                  These core beliefs became the foundation for how I would treat
                  others‚Äîand how I would allow them to treat me. To this day, my
                  core values are:
                  <ol>
                    <li>Don‚Äôt steal</li>
                    <li>Don‚Äôt cheat</li>
                    <li>Don‚Äôt lie</li>
                    <li>Don‚Äôt hit</li>
                    <li>Don‚Äôt call me dumb</li>
                  </ol>
                  I learned that sometimes you have to accept what is and make
                  the best of it. I trust easily and look for the good in
                  people, no matter how small it may be. God was in and out of
                  my life depending on who was around me. As a child, adults are
                  responsible for nourishing us‚Äîphysically, emotionally, and
                  spiritually. As I got older, I felt resentment toward God for
                  not saving me from bad people. But as an adult, I realized
                  just how much He was there for me‚ÄîI just didn‚Äôt know it at the
                  time.

                <h2>Education and Career</h2>
                <p className="born">
                  The first in my family to graduate from college, I earned my
                  Cosmetology License on September 17, 1998. I gave birth to my
                  first child on November 26, 1998, and worked various odd jobs
                  from the age of eight through today. I gave birth to my second
                  child on July 20, 2001. I attempted college a second time but
                  had to resign. After the birth of my third child on April 17,
                  2003, I started a daycare and also did hair and nails to help
                  pay bills. I attempted college again but had to resign once
                  more. I focused on raising my kids and helping others with
                  theirs until my children started school. Then I became an avid
                  volunteer, eventually earning an honorary award for the most
                  volunteer hours that school year. The award was a handmade
                  book from the preschoolers featuring the words they learned to
                  spell that year. Once my kids were all over the age of four, I
                  earned my school bus driver‚Äôs license and drove school buses
                  in both California and Idaho.

                <h2>Later Education & Volunteering</h2>
                <p className="born">
                  After returning home from Idaho, I decided to go back to
                  school for the third time‚Äîand this time, I succeeded. I earned
                  a Bachelor of Arts in Social Science with a concentration in
                  Political Government and Science, and a Bachelor of Arts in
                  Sociology. I developed a real interest in Anthropology. My
                  curiosity grew as we learned about local tribes and how
                  Western influences changed their way of life. I‚Äôve always been
                  fascinated by people‚Äîhow they function both individually and
                  as part of a group. My biggest interest lies in the roles
                  people play in group settings and how each role contributes to
                  the group‚Äôs overall harmony. By then, my kids were old enough
                  to volunteer with me in our community. Over time, much of what
                  we did together counted as community service hours on their
                  school records.

                <p className="born">
                  I attempted college again in 2020 and 2021, but had to take a
                  leave of absence both times due to COVID-related challenges
                  and homelessness. I came off of being homeless on January 21,
                  2022. My vehicle shows more interior wear than it should, but
                  we survived our third period of homelessness since the
                  pandemic began. My good friend Richie played a major role
                  during this time. He helped me through some of the toughest
                  moments.

                <p className="born">
                  On February 19, 2022, an employee from Bitwise Industries told
                  me about their Workforce Training classes in coding and web
                  design. It seemed too good to be true, but after a one-on-one
                  conversation, I decided to enroll. I had my first introduction
                  to coding on February 23, 2022. Like LEGOs and Minecraft
                  before it, I took to coding within days. I learned quickly and
                  was fortunate to help others who struggled. I‚Äôve been
                  preparing for this moment my whole life‚Äîstrategic board games,
                  mystery books, puzzles, LEGOs, Minecraft‚Äîthey all built the
                  foundation for the best skill I‚Äôve ever learned: coding for
                  web design. My first course was{" "}
                  <em>Websites for Beginners</em>. I am currently in{" "}
                  <em>Mobile Friendly</em>, and this website is my final project
                  for the course. I plan to continue with{" "}
                  <em>JavaScript for Beginners</em>, then complete the final
                  course in <em>React</em>. By the end of this course, I hope to
                  have this website fully functioning and live online!

                  I was finally able to buy a trailer home‚ÄîI was so excited! But
                  then, my first grandchild ended up in foster care, and now I‚Äôm
                  preparing to adopt them later this year. Unfortunately, the
                  landowner of the trailer park where I was paying space rent
                  didn‚Äôt want children in the park. He convinced a judge to
                  force me to move. Since then, I‚Äôve been renting rooms for
                  myself and my grandchild while continuing to attend bootcamps.
                  I‚Äôm proud to say I received certifications in both backend and
